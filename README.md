# Explore-the-data-of-your-favorite-YouTube-channel

Introduction

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project aimed at developing a user-friendly Streamlit application that leverages the power of the Google API to extract valuable information from YouTube channels. The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database, subsequently migrated to a SQL data warehouse, and made accessible for analysis and exploration within the Streamlit app.

Scraping the data from the YouTube API

The project utilizes the Google API to scrape the comprehensive data from YouTube channels. The data includes information on channels, playlists, videos, and comments. By interacting with the Google API, we collect the data and merge it into a JSON file.

Storing data in MongoDB

The retrieved data is stored in a MongoDB database. This storage process ensures efficient data management and preservation, allowing for seamless handling of the collected data.

Migrating data to a MySQL

The application allows users to migrate data from MongoDB to MySQL. Users can choose which channel's data to migrate. To ensure compatibility with a structured format, the data is cleansed using the powerful pandas library. Following data cleaning, the information is segregated into separate tables, including channels, playlists, videos, and comments, utilizing SQL queries.

Data Analysis

The project provides comprehensive data analysis capabilities using Plotly and Streamlit. With the integrated Plotly library, users can create interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs to gain insights from the collected data.

Channel Analysis: Channel analysis includes insights on playlists, videos, subscribers, views, likes, and comments. Gain a deep understanding of the channel's performance and audience engagement through detailed visualizations and summaries.

Video Analysis: Video analysis focuses on views, likes, comments, and durations, enabling both an overall channel and specific channel perspectives. Leverage visual representations and metrics to extract valuable insights from individual videos.

Utilizing the power of Plotly, users can create various types of charts, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and more. These visualizations enhance the understanding of the data and make it easier to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.

The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface to interact with the charts and explore the data visually. Users can customize the visualizations, filter data, and zoom in or out to focus on specific aspects of the analysis.

With the combined capabilities of Plotly and Streamlit, the Data Analysis section empowers users to uncover valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
